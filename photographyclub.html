    <h1 align="center">Welcome to Photography Club</h1>
    <p class = "para1">"The main objective of a good photography club should be to encourage its members to take photos while learning to love the craft more. It shouldn't be used as a venue for profit making or for setting up a business. A camera club is a group that embraces the art of photography, not the idea of making money"</p>
