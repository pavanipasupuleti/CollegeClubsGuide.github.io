            <h2>Recycling Unit</h2>
            <p>We see paper all around our environment. Hence, thereâ€™s no doubt that paper indeed, constitutes the greater part of the total garbage collected every day. So, Recycling the waste paper was then recommended. In our college we have this paper recycling unit and students are encouraged to use a recycling bin where they can place all the waste that can easily be recycled</p>
            <ul>
                <l><strong>Benifits of recycling waste papers</strong></li>
                <li>Recycling waste paper prevents air and water pollution which are harmful to our environment.</li>
                <li>It can save trees from being cut and turned into wood pulp</li>
                <li>Saves energy and water.</li>

            <h2>Eco-Friendly Ganesh Idols</h2>
            <p>Ganesh Chaturthi is a festival which is celebrated all over India to worship Lord Ganesh, is becoming more eco-friendly nowadays. Generally, Ganesh murtis are made of Plaster of Paris, are immersed in water after Ganesh Chaturthi, which harms the water bodies.
            In our college every year we make eco-friendlyganesh idols with clay and we distribute them.
